    @title  Pepito. Demo dApp for Machu Picchu. Also Final Project of
    @author Vu Tien Khang
    @notice Pepito is a Caribbian corsair. He can create up to 512 PepitoDisguise
    @notice Pepito's function is similar to ENS Registry.sol, PepitoDisguise is similar to ENS Resolver.sol
    @dev    Pepito's Circuit Breaker stops creating disguises if Hernadez de La Banane discovers the trick :-)
    @dev    The circuit breaker is called to halt everything in case of serious unsolved contract exploit
    @dev    contract Pepito is a factory of disguises.
    @dev    - the main interest of a factory is to maintain an array or mapping of addresses of child contracts
    @dev    - specially useful for persons-in-need because their contract will be their virtual secretary
    @dev        and will maintain their balance of tokens 
    @dev        and will execute the few orders sent via SMS by the persons-in-need
    @dev Pepito contract only manages the array of addresses of disguise smart contract

    @dev    Remix-compiled successfully 2020-12-30
